            I was about 5 years old and my family was taking a long vacation to tour Europe. We were going with 4 other families so there were about 20 people total on this trip. We went to several different places such as Germany, France, Spain, and then we arrived to Belgium. It then went all downhill from there.

            We had rented a tour bus that would take us around the country and show us the main monuments and tourist spots in the country. We stopped at Belgium's mall for about an hour just to explore a bit and have a bathroom break from a long drive. My mom had told my dad to take me to the bathroom, so that is what everyone thought.

            My dad came out of the bathroom and my mom asked where I was. My dad said I was never with him and he thought I was with my mom. Turns out I was lost. For context, before we got out the bus, the tour guide warned all the parents to keep an eye on the kids because a lot of kidnapping happens here. That sent my parents into a frenzy.

            My parents and their friends were running around everywhere screaming my name and trying to find me. They searched for about 30 minutes and I was nowhere to be found. Then, my dad came across some homeless people on the street and asked if they had seen a little boy. They asked my dad for money before they told him anything.

            My dad gave them the money and then they pointed at our tour bus. I was sitting inside peacefully just eating some cookies. So what happened was that I was following my dad to the bathroom. But then I saw our tour guide and started following him instead. I followed him all the way back to the bus and was just sitting there. My mom was crying a lot lol.
